Hey!! @name how are you?
How is your day till now?
Tell me about your sleep in last two weeks? Are you getting a good nap?
In the past two weeks, do you ever felt hopeless?
Do you ever tried to harm yourself by any means? Or you had any thoughts of self harm?
How energetic are you feeling right now?
Would you like to go outside and explore your city?
When was the last time you played games with your friends or went for outing?
Are you dealing with some kind of mental pressures?
